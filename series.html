                    "For my self directed series I wanted to explore the feeling of motion and the energy that exists inside everyday moments. I am drawn to scenes that are full of life and intensity, and I tried to capture that sense of immediacy throughout the project. Instead of setting up formal shoots, I photographed things that were already happening around me. This created a body of work that feels spontaneous and alive. Each image is meant to show a split second where movement becomes something you can feel instead of something you only see.\nThe overall mood of the project is shaped by contrast and tension. Some images have a sense of chaos while others feel focused and controlled. Together they create a mix of fast moments and slower moments that reflect how motion exists in the real world. I am interested in the brief points where time almost seems to pause, as well as the moments that rush forward with force. The project aims to highlight both the power and the beauty found in those experiences.\nMy goal was not to document specific events but to express the emotional impact that movement can have. I wanted the viewer to sense the excitement, pressure, strength, or unpredictability that fills these moments. By working with different kinds of action I hoped to show how movement can shape the atmosphere of an image and create a connection that feels real and immediate.\nThis project helped me appreciate how much can be communicated in a single instant. Motion can be loud or quiet, chaotic or calm, but it always carries emotion. Through this series I wanted to give those feelings a visual form and invite the viewer to experience them as I did.",
