        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-intro">
          I am a photographer drawn to energy, atmosphere, and motion. A lot of my work
          focuses on moments that feel alive whether they are fast, chaotic, controlled,
          or quiet. I am interested in how a single frame can hold tension and emotion
          and how everyday scenes can become powerful when they are photographed with
          intention.
        </p>

        <p class="about-body">
          Instead of building everything from scratch in a studio, I often start with
          what is already happening around me. I look for movement, small shifts in light,
          and brief points where time feels like it slows down or rushes forward. My goal
          is to take those real moments and translate their emotion into images that feel
          immediate and honest.
        </p>

        <p class="about-body">
          Across different assignments and series I explore how light, space, and timing
          shape the mood of a photograph. Some projects are more abstract and focus on
          texture or form, while others center on people, still life, or motion. Together
          they reflect the way I see the world through the camera.
        </p>

        <p class="about-body">
          Photography lets me do more than show what something looks like. It gives me a way
          to share what a moment felt like to stand there and watch it happen. That emotional
          impact is what drives my work and connects all of the images in this portfolio.
